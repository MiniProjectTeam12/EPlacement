# E-PLACEMENT MANAGEMENT
Our mini Project about Placement Cell

# Why E-Placement Management?
Since our college don’t have proper website for managing all the activities of the Training & Placement Cell, 
therefore we have come up with an idea to develop an online website which aims to reducing the manual efforts 
spent by the faculty. Also if any company wants to contact our placement cell through college website then they 
don’t find any contact info and other special information like previous placement records. It will also connect our 
Alumni and Students for placement help.


# Features of Our Proposed System:

# Admin: 
The admin will have the authority to add students and company to the system and
provide them valid ID and password.
